"""
Tip generation module for SmartEdgeBetBot.

This module retrieves today's or tomorrow's soccer matches via the
``odds_fetcher`` module, applies a predictive model to calculate expected
value (EV) for each possible outcome, and returns a formatted list of
betting tips.  The code has been updated to:

* Iterate through **all** bookmakers for each match to find one of the
  preferred bookmakers (Efbet, Betano or Winbet).  Previously the first
  bookmaker was assumed, which often resulted in discarding valid events.
* Use the new ``odds_fetcher`` implementation that dynamically gathers
  active soccer sports and filters matches in the Sofia timezone.
* Maintain the EV/odds filtering logic for high‚Äëvalue tips.
